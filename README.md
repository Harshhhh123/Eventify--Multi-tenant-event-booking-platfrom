# Eventify--Multi-tenant-event-booking-platfrom
Eventify is a production-oriented, microservices-based event booking platform designed to simulate how real-world SaaS systems are built, deployed, and operated at scale.  This project focuses on system design, cloud architecture, DevOps practices, and real production trade-offs, rather than just feature implementation.
